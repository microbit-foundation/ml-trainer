# Data collection hex files

## Bluetooth

The Bluetooth hex files are derived from https://makecode.microbit.org/_MdUU3fEqvRxw

There's a universal hex with each Bluetooth mode. They are then split into individual hex files.

It's important to keep these up-to-date with MakeCode releases so that the apps can partial flash over them.
